        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p class="bio">
            AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by Scottish-born brothers Malcolm and Angus Young. 
            AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, 1975's High Voltage. 
            Membership subsequently stabilised around the Young brothers, singer Bon Scott, drummer Phil Rudd, and bassist Mark Evans. 
            Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced by Cliff Williams, who has appeared on every AC/DC album since 1978's Powerage. 
            In February 1980, Scott died of acute alcohol poisoning after a night of heavy drinking. 
            The group considered disbanding but elected to stay together, bringing in longtime Geordie vocalist Brian Johnson as Scott's replacement.

        <p class="bio">
            AC/DC will assert that they are not specifically a metal band. 
            Their music—loud, hard, and guitar driven—may best be described as hard rock. 
            However, there are people who will say that they are indisputably metal. 
            Therein lies the ongoing problem of categorisation. 
            While AC/DC has referenced the underworld and they have given their listeners 'Highway to Hell' and 'Hell's Bells,' their songs are constructed on straightforward major and minor power chords. 
            They are not modally developed as are a good deal of heavy metal compositions. Their sound is loud and crisp, not muddy or down-tuned.
